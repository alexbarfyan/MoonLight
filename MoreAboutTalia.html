    <p>Born and raised in Glendale, CA, Talia has always liked to work with her hands... and mind. While attending Clark Magney High School, Talia decided that she wanted to start a business. Talia had always wanted to be an entruprenuer and decided that starting a business for her Senior project was the right move.<br><br>
    Talia knew she wanted to start a business ever sinc she was young, but when the time came she didn't know what she wanted to sell. Her sister Kelin Telimyan suggested candles, since Talia had a reltivily siziable collection of candles. 
    <br><br>
    Talia's sister kelin has always been a huge insperation and when the time came Kelin helped Talia get her business off the ground and with a bit of financial help from her parents, her business was off the ground.
    <br><br>
    Now as the newest and high quality candle manufactuer and seller, Moonlight Candles has bloosmed into a bergining Small Business with over 100 sales in just 1 week of launching. '
